<p>We are discovering better ways of building communities by connecting people.</p>

<p>Through this endeavor we have come to value:</p>

<ul id="acts">
 <li><strong>Trust</strong> - which must be respected and never put at risk;</li>
 <li><strong>Dialog</strong> - is the way to establish a truly trustful relationship;</li>
 <li><strong>Personal Contact</strong> - the richest experience, not matched by any media or technology;
 <li><strong>Transparency</strong> - the mean to maintain a sustainable community;</li>
 <li><strong>Diversity</strong> - people have many interests, but if you need a label, label yourself as a human;</li>
 <li><strong>Example</strong> - that's how you must teach, live and learn;</li>
 <li><strong>Consistency</strong> - things take time, intensity is not always the answer;</li>
 <li><strong>Give, give, give!</strong> - you'll be impressed by how fast things will come back;</li>
 <li><strong>Do it!</strong> - as simple as you can, just what is essential to pass it forward.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these elements build the foundation of a <em>Small Act</em> capable of transforming people's lives.</p>
